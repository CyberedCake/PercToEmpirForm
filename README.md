# Percentage to Empirical Formula :books:
This program will automatically convert your percentages into an empirical formula.

It does not show you the work required because... that would be *cheating*, but it's a good way to check your work.

Also, feel free to fork it just don't claim yourself to be the original creator of it.

# Please also note
This program is old, as of August 18th, I will be updating it for the last time, just cleaning some things up and committing some unused files from the last school year. I'm not entirely proud of this project, but it is the first ever "big" thing I worked on in Python, so I guess it is going to be messy and hard-to-read, but oh well. If someone wants to attempt to make this any better, you can by forking it, and despite what it says above, you don't really have to give credit: just fork it on GitHub and you'll be good :thumbsup:.

# Requirements
This script requires elements.txt in the same directory as the python script. I might have found a better way to do this but we'll see, for now, just put it in the same directory.

Also, this project requires ['pyautogui'](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui).
