# Percentage to Empirical Formula
This program will automatically convert your percentages into an empirical formula.

It does not show you the work required because... that would be *cheating*, but it's a good way to check your work.

Also, feel free to fork it just don't claim yourself to be the original creator of it.

# Requirements
This script requires elements.txt in the same directory as the python script. I might have found a better way to do this but we'll see, for now, just put it in the same directory.

Also, a soft-depend of this project is ['pyautogui'](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui), but the program has a way to automatically install it
